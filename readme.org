An expert system to build, formalize, and reason about knowledge
bases. Provides domain-specific languages (DSLs), deductive querying
facilities, and verification of model constraints expressed in a
natural language subset. Inspired by many ideas from /The Art of
Prolog/ and /Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming/.

* Dependencies

The code adheres to ISO/IEC 13211-1 and is compatible with any
standard Prolog implementation.

Developed and tested using [[https://swi-prolog.org][SWI-Prolog]].

* Usage

Within a Prolog REPL:

1. Evaluate ~[kb].~ to load a knowledge base example describing a
   pancreatic anatomy model.

2. Evaluate ~[spec].~ to verify a set of model constraints expressed
   in natural language.

* Design

- Meta DSL layer :: ~mdsl.pl~ acts as a semantic foundation of the
  system, ensuring that any knowledge defined in higher layers follows
  strict correctness rules. It uses term expansion to intercept and
  validate operator definitions.

- DSL layer :: ~dsl.pl~ defines taxonomy and partonomy operators and
  rules, as well as recursive logic to calculate transitive
  properties, such as inheritance in the taxonomy or nested structural
  components in the partonomy.

- Constraint specification language :: ~csl.pl~ allows for the
  formalization and verification of model constraints using a subset
  of natural language, handling universal and existential quantifiers
  by mapping them to logical goals.

- Knowledge base and specification :: ~kb.pl~ and ~spec.pl~ provide an
  example use case, defining the anatomy of the pancreas and a suite
  of model-specific constraints validating adherence to common
  physiological rules.
